Introduction
Mixed beverage sales analysis and modeling is a critical component of the hospitality and restaurant industry. Understanding the factors that influence sales and predicting future sales can help businesses optimize their operations, pricing, and marketing strategies. This README provides an overview of a project focused on analyzing mixed beverage sales and developing a predictive model to assist in decision-making.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze mixed beverage sales data and create a predictive model that can forecast future sales accurately. The model will take into account various factors, such as historical sales data, weather conditions, promotions, and other relevant variables. The ultimate goal is to help businesses in the hospitality industry make informed decisions to increase profitability and customer satisfaction.

Data Collection
The first step in this project is collecting relevant data. This may include:

Historical mixed beverage sales data
Weather data
Promotional data
Customer demographic data
Inventory data
Data can be obtained from internal sources (e.g., POS systems, customer databases) and external sources (e.g., weather APIs, market research firms).

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis and modeling. Common preprocessing steps include:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates)
Feature engineering (creating new features or transforming existing ones)
Data normalization or scaling
Splitting data into training and testing sets
Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves visualizing and summarizing data to gain insights. Key EDA tasks include:

Descriptive statistics
Data visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices)
Identifying patterns and trends
Feature selection
Modeling
The heart of the project involves building predictive models. Common modeling techniques for mixed beverage sales include:

Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, decision trees, neural networks)
Ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting)
Hyperparameter tuning and model selection are critical steps in this phase to ensure the best model performance.

Evaluation
To assess the model's accuracy and generalization ability, various evaluation metrics are used, such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
Cross-validation
The choice of metrics depends on the specific problem and business goals.

Conclusion
The project concludes with a summary of findings and the effectiveness of the predictive model. Recommendations and insights derived from the analysis are provided to help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve their mixed beverage sales.
