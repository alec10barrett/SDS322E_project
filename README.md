Introduction:

Mixed beverage sales analysis and modeling is an important part of the hospitality and restaurant industry. Understanding the factors that influence sales and predicting future sales can help businesses optimize their operations, pricing, and marketing strategies. Our project focuses on the analysis of mixed beverage sales and the development of a predictive model to assist in decision-making.

Objective:

This project's primary objective is to analyze mixed beverage sales data and create a model that can forecast future sales accurately. The model will take into account various factors, such as historical sales data, weather conditions, promotions, and other relevant variables. This will provide insights that may increase profitability and customer satisfaction.


Data Collection:

The first step in this project is collecting relevant data. This may include:

- Historical mixed beverage sales data
- Weather data
- Promotional data
- Customer demographic data
- Inventory data

Data can be obtained from https://data.texas.gov/dataset/Mixed-Beverage-Gross-Receipts/naix-2893. This file contains a list of taxpayers required to report mixed beverage gross receipts tax reports in Austin, Texas. Sources such as government data, weather APIs, or market research firms may also be used.

Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing techniques that we will use:

- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Data normalization or scaling
- Creating train and test sets


Hypothesi:

1. Different times of the year will yield different levels of mixed beverage sales, with January being the lowest.
2. Cloudy weather will yield different types of mixed beverage sales than that of sunny weather.
3. Mixed beverage sales tax will have little effect on the amount of sales.
